       "in roaming without aim or purpose through the perpetual dusk of the spectral wood that clothes\n",

       "the aged Pierre gave to me a family document which he said had for many generations been handed\n",

       "such things as the Philosopher’s Stone, or the Elixir of Eternal Life, and was reputed\n",
       "wise in the terrible secrets of Black Magic and Alchemy. Michel Mauvais had one son, named Charles,\n",
       "a youth as proficient as himself in the hidden arts, and who had therefore been called Le Sorcier,\n",
       "or the Wizard. This pair, shunned by all honest folk, were suspected of the most hideous practices.\n",
       "Old Michel was said to have burnt his wife alive as a sacrifice to the Devil, and the unaccountable\n",
       "disappearances of many small peasant children were laid at the dreaded door of these two. Yet\n",
       "through the dark natures of the father and the son ran one redeeming ray of humanity; the evil\n",

       "than filial affection.<br/>\n",
       "<img alt=\"     \" height=\"1\" src=\"/pics/PixelClear.gif\" width=\"25\"/>One night the castle on the hill was thrown into the wildest confusion by the\n",

       "a huge and violently boiling cauldron. Without certain cause, in the ungoverned madness of fury\n",
       "and despair, the Comte laid hands on the aged wizard, and ere he released his murderous hold\n",
       "his victim was no more. Meanwhile joyful servants were proclaiming the finding of young Godfrey\n",

       "been killed in vain. As the Comte and his associates turned away from the lowly abode of the\n",
       "alchemists, the form of Charles Le Sorcier appeared through the trees. The excited chatter of\n",
       "the menials standing about told him what had occurred, yet he seemed at first unmoved at his\n",

       "and in my utter solitude my mind began to cease its vain protest against the impending doom,\n",

       "Since most of my ancestors had been seized some little while before they reached the exact age\n",

       "In what strange form the curse should overtake me, I knew not; but I was resolved, at least,\n",
       "that it should not find me a cowardly or a passive victim. With new vigour I applied myself\n",
       "to my examination of the old chateau and its contents.<br/>\n",
       "<img alt=\"     \" height=\"1\" src=\"/pics/PixelClear.gif\" width=\"25\"/>It was upon one of the longest of all my excursions of discovery in the deserted\n",
       "portion of the castle, less than a week before that fatal hour which I felt must mark the utmost\n",
       "limit of my stay on earth, beyond which I could have not even the slightest hope of continuing\n",
       "to draw breath, that I came upon the culminating event of my whole life. I had spent the better\n",
       "part of the morning in climbing up and down half-ruined staircases in one of the most dilapidated\n",
       "of the ancient turrets. As the afternoon progressed, I sought the lower levels, descending into\n",
       "what appeared to be either a mediaeval place of confinement, or a more recently excavated storehouse\n",
       "for gunpowder. As I slowly traversed the nitre-encrusted passageway at the foot of the last\n",
       "staircase, the paving became very damp, and soon I saw by the light of my flickering torch that\n",
       "a blank, water-stained wall impeded my journey. Turning to retrace my steps, my eye fell upon\n",
       "a small trap-door with a ring, which lay directly beneath my feet. Pausing, I succeeded with\n",
       "difficulty in raising it, whereupon there was revealed a black aperture, exhaling noxious fumes\n",
       "which caused my torch to sputter, and disclosing in the unsteady glare the top of a flight of\n",
       "stone steps. As soon as the torch, which I lowered into the repellent depths, burned freely\n",
       "and steadily, I commenced my descent. The steps were many, and led to a narrow stone-flagged\n",
       "passage which I knew must be far underground. The passage proved of great length, and terminated\n",
       "in a massive oaken door, dripping with the moisture of the place, and stoutly resisting all\n",
       "my attempts to open it. Ceasing after a time my efforts in this direction, I had proceeded back\n",
       "some distance toward the steps, when there suddenly fell to my experience one of the most profound\n",
       "and maddening shocks capable of reception by the human mind. Without warning, <i>I heard the\n",
       "heavy door behind me creak slowly open upon its rusted hinges.</i> My immediate sensations are\n",
       "incapable of analysis. To be confronted in a place as thoroughly deserted as I had deemed the\n",
       "old castle with evidence of the presence of man or spirit, produced in my brain a horror of\n",
       "the most acute description. When at last I turned and faced the seat of the sound, my eyes must\n",
       "have started from their orbits at the sight that they beheld. There in the ancient Gothic doorway\n",
       "stood a human figure. It was that of a man clad in a skull-cap and long mediaeval tunic of dark\n",
       "colour. His long hair and flowing beard were of a terrible and intense black hue, and of incredible\n",
       "profusion. His forehead, high beyond the usual dimensions; his cheeks, deep-sunken and heavily\n",
       "lined with wrinkles; and his hands, long, claw-like, and gnarled, were of such a deathly, marble-like\n",
       "whiteness as I have never elsewhere seen in man. His figure, lean to the proportions of a skeleton,\n",
       "was strangely bent and almost lost within the voluminous folds of his peculiar garment. But\n",
       "strangest of all were his eyes; twin caves of abysmal blackness, profound in expression of understanding,\n",
       "yet inhuman in degree of wickedness. These were now fixed upon me, piercing my soul with their\n",
       "hatred, and rooting me to the spot whereon I stood. At last the figure spoke in a rumbling voice\n",
       "that chilled me through with its dull hollowness and latent malevolence. The language in which\n",
       "the discourse was clothed was that debased form of Latin in use amongst the more learned men\n",
       "of the Middle Ages, and made familiar to me by my prolonged researches into the works of the\n",
       "old alchemists and daemonologists. The apparition spoke of the curse which had hovered over\n",
       "my house, told me of my coming end, dwelt on the wrong perpetrated by my ancestor against old\n",
       "Michel Mauvais, and gloated over the revenge of Charles Le Sorcier. He told how the young Charles\n",
       "had escaped into the night, returning in after years to kill Godfrey the heir with an arrow\n",
       "just as he approached the age which had been his father’s at his assassination; how he\n",
       "had secretly returned to the estate and established himself, unknown, in the even then deserted\n",
       "subterranean chamber whose doorway now framed the hideous narrator; how he had seized Robert,\n",
       "son of Godfrey, in a field, forced poison down his throat, and left him to die at the age of\n",
       "thirty-two, thus maintaining the foul provisions of his vengeful curse. At this point I was\n",
       "left to imagine the solution of the greatest mystery of all, how the curse had been fulfilled\n",
       "since that time when Charles Le Sorcier must in the course of Nature have died, for the man\n",
       "digressed into an account of the deep alchemical studies of the two wizards, father and son,\n",
       "speaking most particularly of the researches of Charles Le Sorcier concerning the elixir which\n",
       "should grant to him who partook of it eternal life and youth.<br/>\n",
       "<img alt=\"     \" height=\"1\" src=\"/pics/PixelClear.gif\" width=\"25\"/>His enthusiasm had seemed for the moment to remove from his terrible eyes the\n",
       "hatred that had at first so haunted them, but suddenly the fiendish glare returned, and with\n",
       "a shocking sound like the hissing of a serpent, the stranger raised a glass phial with the evident\n",
       "intent of ending my life as had Charles Le Sorcier, six hundred years before, ended that of\n",
       "my ancestor. Prompted by some preserving instinct of self-defence, I broke through the spell\n",
       "that had hitherto held me immovable, and flung my now dying torch at the creature who menaced\n",
       "my existence. I heard the phial break harmlessly against the stones of the passage as the tunic\n",
       "of the strange man caught fire and lit the horrid scene with a ghastly radiance. The shriek\n",
       "of fright and impotent malice emitted by the would-be assassin proved too much for my already\n",
       "shaken nerves, and I fell prone upon the slimy floor in a total faint.<br/>\n",
       "<img alt=\"     \" height=\"1\" src=\"/pics/PixelClear.gif\" width=\"25\"/>When at last my senses returned, all was frightfully dark, and my mind remembering\n",
       "what had occurred, shrank from the idea of beholding more; yet curiosity overmastered all. Who,\n",
       "I asked myself, was this man of evil, and how came he within the castle walls? Why should he\n",
       "seek to avenge the death of poor Michel Mauvais, and how had the curse been carried on through\n",
       "all the long centuries since the time of Charles Le Sorcier? The dread of years was lifted from\n",
       "my shoulders, for I knew that he whom I had felled was the source of all my danger from the\n",
       "curse; and now that I was free, I burned with the desire to learn more of the sinister thing\n",
       "which had haunted my line for centuries, and made of my own youth one long-continued nightmare.\n",
       "Determined upon further exploration, I felt in my pockets for flint and steel, and lit the unused\n",
       "torch which I had with me. First of all, the new light revealed the distorted and blackened\n",
       "form of the mysterious stranger. The hideous eyes were now closed. Disliking the sight, I turned\n",
       "away and entered the chamber beyond the Gothic door. Here I found what seemed much like an alchemist’s\n",
       "laboratory. In one corner was an immense pile of a shining yellow metal that sparkled gorgeously\n",
